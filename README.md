# 05-Space-Shooter
Space shooter for game design 

I literally did it again I'm so sorry. But yeah basically I just used the past two assignments to make a simple asteroid shooter where the asteroids bounce off eachother and the walls and you can shoots the asteroids increasing your score. I'm so sorry for the late assignments this won't happen again
